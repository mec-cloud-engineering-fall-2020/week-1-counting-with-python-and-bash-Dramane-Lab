# Write a function that prints the total number of lines in all the files in the `/files` directory.
# For example, if there are 3 files with 10 lines each, your function should print `30`.
# Your function should still work even if I add or take away files from the directory.

# Extension #1 (optional): Show additional statistics besides the total number of files, 
# such as the average number of lines per file, or the average number of words per line.

# Extension #2 (optional): Write another function, `count_unique`, that only adds up the total 
# number of lines from unique files. For example, if there are three files, A, B, and C, 
# which each have 10 lines, and A and C are the exact same, then you should ignore A, and print 20.

def count():
  # Write your function here
